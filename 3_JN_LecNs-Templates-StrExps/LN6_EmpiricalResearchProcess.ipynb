    "Experimental research skills can be usefully categorized into the cognitive tasks conducted by experimental researchers.  An open-inquiry science project helps train these skills by practicing all the parts of the empirical research process.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "The tasks (and sub-tasks) listed below are not simply chronological steps.  Rather, as Figure 1 indicates, researchers must iteratively improve and loop back as more insights are made and more data are collected which point to superior experimental methods.  For example, conducting and analyzing results from initial exploratory tests or experiments will help to inform, refine, and improve your research goals and subsequent measurements.\n",

    "*A short experiment in a Bachelor's level lab course has negligible chance of significantly extending the boundaries of scientific knowledge, thus an extensive literature review is not necessary (nor possible given the time constraints).  But, your results must be compared to relevant scientific models and empirical studies, and knowing of them ahead of time is critical for guiding your experimental process.* \n",

    "\n",
    "You should explore many possible preliminary designs (the basic design has likely already been identified in previous steps, but now its details should be carefully considered).  These design details will need revisited based on your considerations in the sub-tasks below, and then again after initial tests have been conducted.\n",
    "\n",

    "### \tData analysis methods\n",
    "\n",
    "You must also specify methods for data processing and analysis.  The method by which your experimental data are compared with theoretical models influences the uncertainties (see next sub-task).\n",
    "\n",
    "## \tIdentify uncertainties and limits of models/assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Identify sources of measurement uncertainty and analyze relevant variables that may lead to systematic errors in results and interpretation.  What are the effects of imperfect models and assumptions?  Quantifying these requires having complex cause and effect models for the experiment.   (This sub-task will be repeated after measuring performance of the apparatus.)\n",

    "\n",
    "Finalize the design, taking into account construction details and performance requirements of each component.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data acquisition strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Experimental design also includes data-taking procedures.  These must take into account constraints on time, clarity of results, all potential statistical and systematic uncertainties, and the importance and requirements for distinguishing between different potential interpretations of results.  An uncertainty budget which estimates the effects of different (propagated) sources of uncertainty will help in deciding how to prioritize your time & effort.  For instance, you may decide that some unimportant quantities need not be measured.  (These sub-tasks will be repeated after measuring performance of the apparatus.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Set parameters and range of independent variable(s)\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the range and step-size of the independent variable are important for your experiment's sensitivity to the expected effects, as too small of a range means too small of an effect while too large of a step-size (and too few data points) prevents a reliable comparison to a theoretical model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The choices for fixed parameters are also often important for maximizing effect size, minimizing uncertainty, or simplifying experimental design.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sequence of measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "The sequences that measurements are taken can play two important roles.  \n",
    "\n",
    "First, many physical systems exhibit **hysteresis**.  When the effects of hysteresis cannot be eliminated, they can instead be worked around by controlling the order that measurements are taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, sometimes the desired ranges of independent variables are not known in advance and must be sorted out during an experiment.  Starting with \"safe\" and/or \"interesting\" values and analyzing on the fly allows researchers to efficiently adjust their measurement plans accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data averaging\n",
    "\n",
    "Data averaging is important whenever type A uncertainties are a significant part of your uncertainty budget.  Repetition of measurements and longer signal averaging increase precision and accuracy by decreasing the effects of uncontrolled & variable sources of noise.  Unfortunately, even the simplest sources of type A uncertainty only decrease by a factor of $1/\\sqrt{N}$ or $1/\\sqrt{T}$, where $N$ and $T$ are the number or measurements and the averaging time, respectively.  Thus, the need to measure for 100x longer to achieve a factor of 10 decrease in such a type A uncertainty may limit your potential improvements. "

For instance, statistical tests for significance can show the likelihood of a set of measurements under a given null hypothesis - but they often implicitly assume that type B systematic uncertainties are negligible.  In this case it is better to propagate the type B uncertainty through to the bounds of a confidence interval (itself constructed from the statistical uncertainty).  Thus, the next two sub-tasks can either justify or refute your methods in this one.\n",
