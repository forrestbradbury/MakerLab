    "In this course and in this introductory structured experiment, you will use electrically controlled & read-out sensors to make measurements for your experiments.  These sensors must be hooked up to your Arduino:  which is just a printed circuit board consisting of some electrical components, connectors, and a microcontroller which you will progam to control and take measurements from sensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "A microcontroller is like a mini-computer, and in the case of the Arduino, it's a computer which has to be programmed by you to do something very specific - often over and over again.  When getting started, you will use a USB cable from your laptop to both provide power (the USB connection includes a ground and a +5 V line) and to exchange data with the Arduino.  The first data that you will exchange will be uploading of a new program to the Arduino.  After uploading it to its (rather limited) static memory, the Arduino carries out that program whenever it is powered up or whenever the \"reset\" button is pushed.  After successfully uploading a program, the Arduino will boot up and carry out these orders even without a connection to a laptop when it is instead powered up remotely by a battery or by a USB charging adapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Arduino's micrcontroller interfaces with the world using some special electrical tools situated on the printed circuit board.  Important for us are the so-called digital and analog pins where small wires can be connected to either take measurements of electrical voltages (when assigned as `input`) or rather control the voltage of these pins (when assigned as `output`).\n",

    "There is a nifty online environment for writing code and sending commands to the Arduino.  However, you will likely eventually run into problems by always requiring an internet connection to interface with your Arduino.  Therefore, it is recommended that you follow the instructions to download & install the Arduino software (the \"Arduino Desktop IDE\", or integrated development environment), which can be found here:  \n",

    "# Experiment:  estimating \"g\" via measuring a pendulum's oscillation period\n",
    "\n",
    "In this introductory assignment, you will learn by doing:  taking actual measurements with the help of your Arduino in pursuit of a scientific question.  This experiment is chosen because it's relatively easy to conceptualize and implement - and if you work carefully enough, you might even uncover some extra significant digits of \"g\" in your specific location on our spinning globe!\n",
    "\n",
    "> But, is this a real scientific question?  After all, we've all read that the acceleration due to the pull of gravity on the earth's spinning surface is $9.81$ m/s/s, right?  In fact, due to the earth's spinning, the different elevations of the earth's surface, and the inhomogeneous density of the earth itself, the values for \"g\" range from $9.76392$ to $9.81974$ m/s/s [C. Hirt et al. \"New ultrahigh-resolution picture of Earth's gravity field\". Geophysical Research Letters. 40 (16) p4279, 2013].  You can probably find maps of how \"g\" changes across the earth's surface to find out what other scientific studies have already concluded for your location, but here you will perform the measurement yourself with a simple pendulum (in a method conceptually identical to older types of gravitometers, like the Kater's pendulum).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scientific background\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a pendulum's period to estimate \"g\" relies on the force of gravity written in terms of this acceleration:  $ \\left\\| F_{gravity} \\right\\| = mg $.  For oscillations with small swing angles, a simple pendulum (of length $L$) can be approximated as a harmonic oscillator with a period approximated by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ T \\ \\approx \\ 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{L}{g}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"simple pendulum\" model (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendulum_(mathematics)#Simple_gravity_pendulum) involves some assumptions, many of which are approximately true, but none of which are exactly true:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  the pendulum bob is a point mass\n",
    "-  the string on which the pendulum bob swings is massless and constant in length\n",
    "-  the pendulum's support cannot move\n",
    "-  no energy is lost due to friction nor air resistance\n",
    "-  the pendulum swings in a two dimensional plane\n",
    "-  the pull of gravitaty is constant in time and space\n",
    "\n",
    "The simple pendulum's \"harmonic approximation\" breaks down for large swing angles.  A more accurate prediction (though still using the approximations inherent in the simple pendulum model) has higher order even terms in the maximum swing angle [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendulum_(mathematics)]:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ T \\ = \\ 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{L}{g}} \\left( 1+\\frac{1}{16}\\theta_{max}^2 +\\frac{11}{3072}\\theta_{max}^4 + ... \\right)  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of the form you use, you'll need to measure the length and the period (and possibly also the maximum swing angle) to find \"g\".  The length and maximum swing angle can be measured with the help of a simple ruler or tape measure, and the oscillation period can be measured with the help of an IR break-beam sensor, as shown in Figure 1 below.\n",

    "\n",
    ">Figure 1.  Cartoon image of a pendulum passing through the infrared beam between an IR transmitter (emitter) and receiver (sensor) - which together make up an IR break-beam sensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the figure helps makes clear, the pendulum should break the infrared beam twice per oscillation period.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Setting up a pendulum\n",
    "\n",
    "There is not a single \"right\" way to set up and swing a pendulum.  However, you should keep in mind your measurement limitations and remember that the simple pendulum model makes several simplifying assumptions.  Good choices for sizes & materials can allow an actual pendulum to be modeled more accurately, and also provide easier-to-measure parameters and results.\n",
    "\n",
    "For better approximation by a theoretical model, consider using a dense and heavy mass and a rather large pendulum length.  A heavy pendulum bob means that the drag force is less significant compared to both the gravitational pull and the changing momentum (which is good, as most theoretical models ignore drag entirely).  Further, when the mass's size is small compared to the length of the string it swings from, the system is better approximated by the simple \"point mass\" model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to keep relative measurement uncertainties low, be sure that your parameter values and resulting period are both much larger than their respective measurement uncertainties!  For instance, a tiny $1$ cm long pendulum would have a relatively inaccurate length determination (when just using a tape measure) and would oscillate with a very short period (where the timing accuracy also becomes a problem).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it's best to hang the pendulum from a sturdy object with a fixed pivot point.  In the absence of a dedicated stand, a simple table will do just fine.  <span style=\"font-size:larger;color:red\">**For safety's sake, please always keep swing angles small.  Besides safety considerations, smaller swing angles are more easily approximated as you see in the formulas above.**</span>\n",

The Sketch then instructs the Arduino to use the read value to control the state of a yellow LED (labeled \"L\" on the Arduino board).

    "- It also does an `analogRead()` of the IR sensor signal which monitors its voltage.  An `analogRead()` uses a 10-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to map voltages between 0V and +5V to the $2^{10}$ integers between $0$ and $1023$.  \n",

You will need to confirm which COM port your Arduino has been allocated to, and set the Serial Monitor appropriately.  And, you may need to check the baud rate matches the 9600 used here in this Sketch.  In case you prefer instructional videos and images, here is Paul McWhorter's first lesson on the Serial Monitor: http://www.toptechboy.com/arduino/arduino-lesson-4-printing-over-the-serial-port/\n",

    "> IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT WIRING CHANGES AND THE CIRCUIT DIAGRAM:  In addition to attaching the IR sensor's signal lead to digital pin4 and to a 47k$\\Omega$ resistor going to +5V, we also now connect it to analog pinA0, as this lets the Arduino also measure its voltage (in addition to the digital read saying whether it's HIGH or LOW).  While we actually only care whether the beam is broken or not, your future experimental projects will likely involve measuring voltages via the Arduino's ADC using the `analogRead()` function, so it's nice to see how it works in a simple situation."

    "\n",
    "This first project aims to teach how the Arduino works and how it can be used to collect sensor data.  Thus, these Arduino Sketches were mainly designed to show what is happening during the analog and digital measurements.  For this IR break-beam pendulum experiment, however, a good next step might be writing a more advanced code that ONLY sends time stamps when the infrared beam is found to become broken/unbroken.  This would save lots of data going over the serial port AND it may allow an even better timing precision since checking whether the beam is broken or not does not have to wait on the sending of a bunch of mostly useless data.  Further, cutting out the `analogRead()` and only performing a `digitalRead()` would also allow for a faster data rate because the ADC's analog reading takes significantly longer than a digital read.  You are encouraged to write a better Arduino Sketch, and thus improve on this last Sketch's time reading uncertainty of $u_{T-read} = 4$ milliseconds.\n"
