    "A module is a Python program with useful functions that are intended to be used within other Python programs. There are many Python modules, a lot of which are part of the Python standard library:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Math**: supports numerical constants and operations like `sin`, `log`, etc.\n",
    "- **Random**: a module for random number generation\n",
    "- **Pickle**: a module for saving arbitrary Python objects to a file or transmitting them over the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there are also modules distributed by other parties, and some of these are very sophisticated:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NumPy**: a module that supports efficient linear algebra and other numerical methods\n",
    "- **Matplotlib**: a module for making graphs and charts.\n",
    "- **Pandas**: a module for working with R-style data frames\n",
    "- **ScikitLearn**: a module that contains many machine learning algorithms\n",
