here are some ideas for near & medium term improvements or additions:

1. create extra assignment to practice data analysis (mathematical modeling & uncertainty analysis).  AUC's Maker Lab students said this is one of the more significant things they missed in the course.
2. grading forms:  
  a. change format (now in Microsoft Word, but it would be handy to combine a text-based input form with a database of course grades)    
  b. create proper rubrics (describing to students what is expected of their work for each grade category)
3. videos:   
  a. redo Sensor lecture #2 (possibly extending a bit to mention I2C board-to-board communication used by many MEMS sensors)   
  b. Maker Lab material introduction lecture?
