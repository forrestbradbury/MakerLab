    "# Assignment and Learning Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "The semi-structured experiment is a relatively short assignment consisting of approximately 10-20 work-hours, depending on how familiar each student already is with the relevant skills, and whether the sensor wiring has already been sorted out by instructors.  While it is not an open-inquiry project, hopefully some design-thinking is stimulated via the comparison of the different ways of measuring \"g\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment's organization\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 4 different experiments, and 4 students to a group (which is assigned a single experiment).  However, each 4-person group consists of two pairs, and **each of the two pairs must separately perform the experiment**; and only afterwards should the entire group of 4 students coalesce to compare results and put together the presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The presentation itself should consist of:\n",
    "- demonstrations of both pairs' setups and working Sketches (i.e. Arduino codes)\n",
    "- oral explanations of the process:  the stumbling blocks, failures, and improvements\n",
    "- oral and poster presentation of data analysis and results, including uncertainty in \"g\" estimation \n",
    "\n",
    ">NOTE:  The \"poster\" part of the presentation need not be a large-format printed poster, but instead can simply be several printouts on regular paper with fontsize large enough (~24pt) to be seen from a couple meters distance.  If the presentation is delivered remotely, the \"poster\" should be replaced with images and figures (in slides, short films, and/or live webcam/screenshare) which show off both the setups and the results.  Please refer to assessement description for details.\n",
    "\n",
    ">REMEMBER:  Presentation of figures should follow standard practices:  making sure to give a descriptive title, label axes, include units, distinguish data series with a legend, and denote data with points instead of connected lines (unless there are good reasons to do otherwise).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "The Learning Outcomes relevant to this semi-structured experiment include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- learning & employing Maker skills for experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "- science communication with a focus on explaining methods\n",
    "\n",
    "- data analysis with a focus on measurement uncertainty (see:  [LN3_Uncertainty-Analysis](LN3_Uncertainty-Analysis.ipynb))\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these explicit learning outcomes, students should afterwards compare their own experiment (and its results) with the other experimental options:  Which of them leads to a determination of \"g\" having the lowest uncertainty?  Have all the important sources of uncertainty been accurately quantified?\n",
    "\n",
    "The general purpose of this semi-structured experiment is to learn skills that help in completing the subsequent open-inquiry projects.\n"

    "# Introduction of Experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "There are often many ways to measure the exact same quantity, some good, some better, and some really convoluted and/or inaccurate!  It’s often difficult to say ahead of time which methods are preferable, hence the need for back-of-the-napkin calculations (i.e. rough estimates) and pilot studies (i.e. trial and error).  \n",
    "\n",
    "In these semi-structured experiments, we are going to measure the same quantity several different ways, and we are going to save our judgment on these experimental ideas until the results have come in (and hopefully learn some good lessons in the process).  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Determining (again, and again...) the Earth’s Apparent Acceleration Due to Gravity\n",
    "\n",
    "These semi-structured experiments are designed to be completed after the introductory structured experiment (with the pendulum and IR break-beams).  Just like in that activity, you will use a sensor controlled by an Arduino to estimate \"g\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, you are asked to utilize your assigned method (a choice of the below options, #1-#4) to the best of your abilities to achieve the most accurate and precise result possible.  The first three options again involve measuring the period of a pendulum's oscillation to infer the acceleration of gravity.  The last, #4, instead requires you to time a falling object (over a measured distance) to infer the acceleration of gravity a bit more directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please stay within the bounds of the instructions.  Your later open-inquiry projects will give plenty of chance for creative tweaks and optimization of the experimental design.  These introductory experiments, on the other hand, confine you to a method.  Regardless of whether the method seems like a good or bad one, you are expected to follow it and share your findings.  \n",
    "\n",
    "And, please don’t fudge your data…  Besides constituting fraud and contributing to inaccurate conclusions, please know that you will NOT be rewarded for over-stating the accuracy or precision of your measurement result!  You will, on the other hand, be rewarded for clear and accessible explanations of your work and insightful and understandable analyses of your results.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some silly inspiration on measuring the same quantity several different ways, please read the following story: http://www.unz.com/print/SaturdayRev-1968dec21-00060/?View=PDF or even more of such zany ideas at:  https://jcdverha.home.xs4all.nl/scijokes/2_12.html"

    "# Semi-structured experiment choices:\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick note on all experiments:  All of them involve collecting sensor data using your Arduinos.  Some of the Arduino Sketches that you'll be using are longer and more complicated than what you've seen already for the IR break-beam, and you might encounter some of the following initial difficulties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- bugs:  a Sketch provided here or found online may use different pins, names, or addresses than what you're using, or there may even be real mistakes that need fixing.  Try to go through the Sketch line-by-line to get an idea of its logical flow, and use the `Serial.print()` command to check that certain variables have been correctly assigned or that certain processes have (successfully) occurred.\n",
    "- sometimes the Arduino doesn't connect correctly with the IDE on the laptop when its USB cable is inserted, and you just need to unplug and try again.\n",
    "- somemtimes the Arduino's Serial Monitor (or Python's Serial port connection) claims that the serial port is busy and cannot connect.  A Sketch that spends alot of time printing to the Serial port may cause this to happen more frequently.  Just retry the Serial Monitor, and in the case of the Python Serial port reading code, run a `ser.close()` command (in a separate code cell) and then try again.\n",
    "- the Arduino Sketches and Jupyter Notebook code which were already provided to you for the IR break-beam sensing will be useful reference materials, and you may want to copy some of their functionalities for your semi-structured experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "> REMEMBER:  The document [Arduino-Intro_and_Structured-Experiment](Arduino-Intro_and_Structured-Experiment.ipynb) serves as an introduction to using the Arduino to control sensors, and also shows how to read Serial port data directly with Python code."

    "## Exp#1:  swing along\n",
    "an accelerometer, an Arduino, and a datalogger board all ride the pendulum\n",
    "\n",
    "### description and motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "All the other experimental methods involve ways to time pendulum swings (or free-fall drops) by sensing a moving object with stationary equipment.  Here, the sensor rides with the object!  In this way, we hope to eliminate the need for fine alignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since an accelerometer is actually sensitive to both gravity and acceleration, it should be sensitive to the swing position of a pendulum in two ways:  1. at the lowest point of the pendulum's swing, it's moving fastest along its circular path, and thus has maximum centripetal acceleration.  2. at the highest points of a pendulum's swing, the force of gravity is no longer directed perfectly along the pendulum's string, and thus will be minimized along that axis for these largest angles.  Both effects mean the acceleration along the pendulum string's axis should oscillate with a period that is half the pendulum's period.  So long as these oscillations are big enough to see, it's really only their time periodicity which is important (and thus **you do NOT have to estimate the magnitude of the acceleration oscillations**).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can collect acceleration data as a function of time (also saving timestamp data for each acceleration measurement using the Arduino's internal timer functions:  `millis()` or `micros()` ).  From this, there are many ways of extracting the period of an oscillating signal, including plotting and manual estimation, curve fitting with a sinusoidal function, or taking a Fourier transform.  Please seek help for the data analysis if and when you need it!\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible advantages of Exp#1 as compared to the others:\n",
    "- directly measures motion, rather than relying on error-prone remote-tracking of an object.  \n",
    "- also, the measured (and changing) acceleration during the swinging is an extra check on the one inferred from the observed oscillation frequency, and gives an idea about the accuracy of the acccelerometer's calibration.  \n",
    "- finally, any of these methods which infer “g” from pendulum oscillations are probably more accurate than via free-fall because the pendulum never obtains velocities where the air’s drag is significant and because many oscillations can be observed over long times meaning the relative uncertainty due to limited clock precision becomes negligibly small!\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible disadvantage of Exp#1 as compared to the others:\n",
    "- isn't this an overly-complicated way to time a swing?  Quite possibly, yes, but it will hopefully be a fun way to learn some very useful Maker skills (like doing remote sensing:  where the Arduino runs and records data without a connection to a laptop).\n"

    "- 9V battery to power Arduino, and holder:  https://www.adafruit.com/product/67\n",
    "- a heavy pendulum bob (> 0.5 kg) should be used because all the equipment swinging along with the pendulum will increase the air's drag!  (Think about the assumptions in the simple pendulum model, as outlined in section 2.1 in the [Arduino-Intro_and_Structured-Experiment](Arduino-Intro_and_Structured-Experiment.ipynb)  document.)  A sealed water bottle for instance?  <span style=\"font-size:larger;color:brown\">**Make certain that the heavy mass cannot fall on your toes!!**</span> \n",
    "- a tape measure for measuring string length\n",
    "\n",
    "### important notes before starting\n",
    "\n",
    "- Soldering the shield stacking headers to the Accelerometer board and the Data logger shield is tricky.  If your instructors have not already done it, you need training before trying it yourself.  \n",
    "  - The shield stacking headers should be used **instead of** the pins provided in the Data logger shield's and Accelerometer board's own packages because the \"headers\" allow for easier further connections with jumper wires (instead of more soldering)!  \n",
    "  - By default, the MPU-6050 Accelerometer board tries to communicate with the Arduino using an identical address that is already used by the Data logger shield, and leads to communication errors.  Luckily, there is a way to rewire the Accelerometer board to change its address.  (see reference to AD0 pin here:  https://learn.adafruit.com/mpu6050-6-dof-accelerometer-and-gyro/pinouts  and discussion here:  https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=255033.0 and ask for soldering help if this fix has not already been completed)\n",
    "- The Data logger shield requires a small 3V coincell battery to work (even when it receives power from the Arduino).\n",
    "- In order for the pendulum's swinging to cause changes in acceleration large enough to easily measure with the accelerometer (given its precision limit), you may need to induce larger changes in acceleration using larger angle displacements.  However, large swing angles would then necessitate using a more precise relation between \"g\" and the oscillation period which depends on the maximum angle correction.  See the structured experiment document ([Arduino-Intro_and_Structured-Experiment](Arduino-Intro_and_Structured-Experiment.ipynb)) or wikipedia for this relation:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendulum_(mathematics)#Power_series_solution_for_the_elliptic_integral\n",
    "- When battery powered (like by a 9V battery), the Arduino will start up and run whatever Sketch it was last loaded with.  The \"reset\" button on the Arduino further allows you to restart a Sketch whenever you desire.\n"

    "### description and motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the only method that accurately tracks the position of the pendulum bob versus time.  Here, an ultrasound transmitter and receiver board can be positioned at one side of the pendulum's swing, and measure its distance away as a function of time to infer the oscillation amplitude and period.  \n",
    "\n",
    "An ultrasound device (or sonar ranging device) works in the same way that bats navigate in the dark:  sending out short bursts of sound (chirps) which reflect off objects and come back to the device to be detected.  The time delay between the sending and receiving tells us (or the bat) the distance to the reflecting object, according to the speed of sound in air.  The name \"ultrasound\" is used because our device uses sound which is higher frequency than what our ears are sensitive to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of just measuring a pendulum's period, the sonar (ultrasound) sensor enables measurement of the position in time.  Advanced data analysis methods can then more accurately determine the period:  for instance a Fourier transform of the entire data set can accurately pick out a dominate oscillation frequency, or performing curve fitting as a damped oscillation can improve this frequency estimation further.  Please seek help for the data analysis if and when you need it!\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible advantages of Exp#2 as compared to the others:\n",
    "- this position versus time (which can be easily converted to angle versus time in the limit of small swing angles) is much richer information than just knowing when an object passes a certain position in space, and it is more directly relevant than the acceleration information gathered in Exp#1. \n",
    "- additionally, any of these methods which infer “g” from pendulum oscillations are probably more accurate than via free-fall because the pendulum never obtains velocities where the air’s drag is significant and because many oscillations can be observed over long times meaning the relative uncertainty due to limited clock precision becomes negligibly small!\n",

Since the ultrasound device works best in detecting a rather large & rather flat surface, you may need a larger pendulum bob or a flat object that faces to sensor and is fixed to your pendulum.

    "### description and motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment utilizes a proximity sensor to infer the period of a pendulum, and does so for many different pendulum lengths.   Just like the ultrasound device, it can be positioned at one side of the pendulum's swing from where it measures the pendulum bob's \"proximity\" as a function of time.  The proximity sensor is the easiest of the experiments to setup, and for this reason, you're asked to do it many times for many lengths ( >15 ) to find how/whether your estimations of \"g\" depend on the pendulum's length.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our mobile phones use proximity sensors to detect when they are brought to our ears for talking (and can thereby turn off the screen during our conversation to save battery life.)  These proximity sensors send out an infrared beam (IR) and have a sensor that measures the amount of IR light that is reflected back to it by nearby objects.  Most objects reflect significant amounts of IR light, and thus the detected light is roughly a measure of distance (because far away objects will typically reflect a smaller amount of the IR beam back to the small detector).  Because it is an inexact measurement of distance, a \"proximity\" value is given, which actually is large for close-by objects and goes to zero for far away objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can collect proximity data as a function of time (also saving timestamp data for each proximity measurement using the Arduino's internal timer functions:  `millis()` or `micros()` ).  From this, there are many ways of extracting the period of an oscillating signal, including plotting and manual estimation, curve fitting to a sinusoidal function, or taking a Fourier transform.  Please seek help for the data analysis if and when you need it!\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible advantages of Exp#3 as compared to the others:\n",
    "- while the proximity sensor is not more accurate for timing than the IR break-beam setup, it will be a bit less sensitive to changing alignments as the pendulum swings (just one sensor device is needed and can be placed at the end of the pendulum motion). \n",
    "- the big advantage in this method comes from the use of different pendulum lengths, each of which gives an estimate for “g”.  There will likely be difficulties in this measurement with very long and short pendulum lengths, and the series of measurements will allow better understanding of these problems.\n",
    "- finally, any of these methods which infer “g” from pendulum oscillations are probably more accurate than via free-fall because the pendulum never obtains velocities where the air’s drag is significant and because many oscillations can be observed over long times meaning the relative uncertainty due to limited clock precision becomes negligibly small!\n",
