    "# Jupyter Notebook introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic intro\n",
    "\n",
    "The main reason Jupyter Notebook is used to share Maker Lab materials is it integrates a programming environment with text & figures which together create easy-to-follow notes or reports of quantitative materials.  An added benefit is that Jupyter Notebook files are text-based, which means they are easier to share across platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"Markdown\"  (more on this below!)\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to Python code cells and raw text cells, Jupyter Notebook allows the use of \"Markdown\", which is a very simple text-enrichment language that enables you to add nice features to your document, such as different fonts, mathematical formulas, tables, and inserted images.  Since the Maker Lab Jupyter Notebook materials use Markdown, you can double-click on the text cells in this and other documents to see the typed-out text which determines the formatting you see, and then hit `SHIFT-ENTER` to break out of editing mode:  this renders/typesets the Markdown cell, and allows you to again see the results.  You are welcome and encouraged to change things in this document to experiment and better understand how Markdown and Jupyter Notebook both work.  Below, the later sections in this document show how to use some important Markdown features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like the Markdown cells, the Python cells can be run by typing `SHIFT-ENTER`.  Jupyter notebooks are edited in your browser, which cannot itself execute Python code.  Your browser thus connects with a Python interpreter (called the \"Kernel\" that runs as a separate process on your computer) and sends it code (whenever you select **Run** or type `SHIFT-ENTER`) to evaluate, and then displays the results.  This is what the \"Kernel\" menu refers to.  If nothing is happening in your notebook while you're trying to execute some code, you may need to restart the kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Navigating cells\n",
    "\n",
    "As you're using a Jupyter notebook, you'll notice that there's always one active cell which is highlighted in either blue or green.  If it's green, you're *editing* the cell, if it's blue, you've simply *selected* it.  While outside of edit mode (i.e. when your active cell is highlighted in blue), there are a couple of keystrokes you need to master to manage your notebook conveniently:\n",

    "- Create another code cell, enter \"`# this is a comment`\", and evaluate it.  There should not be a result because everything in a line after the hashtag in Python is ignored by the Kernel and only meant to help humans interpret and remember the meaning of the bits of code. \n",
    "- Leave the cell editing mode by hitting *Shift+Enter*, use the *P* shortcut key to access the command palette, and see if your table of contents (TOC) is available as one of the palette's last options.  If not, see directions for setting this up in the cell below.\n",

Note, you can also create links in your Markdown text without showing the full website text like this:  [link](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html \"Markdown help\")*  \n",
    "\n",
    "(Remember to double-click or press `enter` while on a cell to see the text used to achieve the typeset results!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides the resource linked above, this cell overviews some of the most important tricks:\n",
    "\n",
    "## *Italic* and **Bold**\n",
    "\n",
    "Surrounding text with single asterisks makes it *italic*, while surrounding with two asterisks makes it **bold**, and using three asterisks makes it both ***italic and bold***.\n",
    "\n",
    "## `Highlighting text`\n",
    "\n",
    "In several instances above, you can see that the left apostrophe surrounding text makes it highlighted, and is often used for highlighting code functions or file names, for instance the name of this file is:  `JupyterNotebook-editingtricks.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Font size and color\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown allows the use of html code.  We saw in the first cell above that HTML code can be used to increase the size and change the color of the word <span style=\"font-size:24pt;color:pink\">Outline</span>.  Adding the bold command from above, we can make some:  **<span style=\"font-size:24pt;color:pink\">Large, Pink, and Bold Text!</span>**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lists (bulleted or numbered)\n",
    "\n",
    "Bulleted lists are created using dashes before items, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- bulleted item #1\n",
    "- bulleted item #2\n",
    "- bulleted item #3\n",
    "  - sub-bullet 3.A (needs two spaces in front of the dash)\n",
    "  - sub-bullet 3.B\n",
    "    - sub-sub bullet 3.B.a (an extra two spaces)\n",
    "    - sub-sub bullet 3.B.b \n",
    "    \n",
    "For numbered lists, a number followed by a `.` tells Markdown to count the bullets.  The actual number doesn't matter to Markdown, so you can be lazy and use any random number and let Markdown do the counting for you:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. bulleted item #1\n",
    "1. bulleted item #2\n",
    "1. bulleted item #3\n",
    "  1. sub-bullet 3.A (needs two spaces in front of the `1.`)\n",
    "  2. sub-bullet 3.B\n",
    "    1. sub-sub bullet 3.B.a (needs two extra spaces)\n",
    "    1. sub-sub bullet 3.B.b \n",
    "\n",
    "## Indentation\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create an indented block of text (like for a long quote or like in this document's outline) by using a greater-than symbol (`>`) at the start of all the relevant lines:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Here is an indented line of text,  \n",
    "> and here is another!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Horizontal line\n",
    "\n",
    "At the very top of this cell which you are now reading, you can see that three asterisks on an otherwise blank line creates a horizontal line.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Headers & sub-headers\n",
    "\n",
    "Section headers (and sub-headers and sub-sub-headers) are created using a hash tag (or two or three of them) followed by a space and the header text.  Headers and sub-headers are already shown below.  Sub-sub-headers and sub-sub-sub-headers look like this:\n",

    "Markdown has a math-mode similar to LaTeX.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Anything written between dollar signs ($) is interpreted as mathematical text.  However, the dollar sign in this paragraph is not followed by a second one later in the paragraph, and thus Markdown is smart enough to instead render it as an actual dollar sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are actually two ways of including mathematical text.  If double dollar signs are used, it creates a new line for the expression and centers it, like this:  $$ -1 = e^{i \\pi }$$  But, you can also write mathematical text in-line inside your paragraphs when using single dollar signs to bracket the expressions:  $\\sum\\limits_i F_i = m a$ , which is an expression of Newton's famous second law.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you dig further into it, there are even ways to align mathematical equations, number them, and refer to them later in the text:\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where we have used the `\\frac{}{}` command to make nice fractions in Equation (\\ref{eq1}) and the `\\vec{}` command to show that Forces and Acceleration are vectors in Equation (\\ref{eq2}).  Also, the `&` tells the `align` function that the equations should vertically line up at the indicated equal signs, which is admittedly strange here because the two equations have no relation to each other, but is sometimes handy for showing long derivations.\n",
    " \n",
    "Please note that units and unit abbreviations should not be included inside math-mode.  Rather, units and abbreviations should be separated by a space and written in normal text.  As an example, the accepted value of the Earth's apparent gravitational acceleration in Amsterdam, reported to two significant digits, is:  $g=9.8$ m/s/s"
