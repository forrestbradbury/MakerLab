# Why use open-inquiry flipped-lab methods with Arduinos?

The following questions give a motivation for these methods.

## Why remote or ‘flipped-lab’ methods?

Besides the urgent issues surrounding giving lab courses during the continuing pandemic, our experience in the pilot demonstrated a couple intrinsic advantages of a flipped lab that are worthy of partial continuation even after on-campus instruction can fully resume:  

First, it is hard to imagine a better way to increase student ownership than to allow them 24-hour per day and 7-day per week control of the equipment which is set up by them in their own living spaces, kitchens, or backyards.  And, while they receive plenty of (remote) coaching and support, all the actual physical work & progress is theirs alone.  

Second by allowing them to do the actual experiments in their own time, the contact time with instructors gives them ample experience with (and responsibility for) oral communication in an authentic scientific context and these discussions focus naturally on more difficult parts of the empirical research cycle and their own open inquiries.  The students in the pilot Maker Lab course reported really appreciating this contact time & attention.

## Why open inquiry?

In an open-inquiry experiment, students perform the entire empirical research cycle by first choosing their own research questions and designing their experimental methods.  

Pedagogical literature suggests that physical science labs should focus on teaching research skills by engaging students in self-designed open scientific inquiries rather than more traditional structured or “cookbook” experiments [1-5].  In fact, labs that instead prioritize teaching scientific concepts over research skills have been shown to be ineffective in teaching concepts [1] and actually detrimental for the development of expert-like thinking about experimental science [2].  Luckily, there is now a large body of pedagogical literature pointing to open inquiry’s success in teaching typical lab course learning outcomes.  Open-ended labs in which students design and carry out their own investigations are able to positively train scientific thinking and, as a bonus, students evaluate them enthusiastically [6-9].

## Why Maker methods?

We chose Arduinos and the myriad variety of sensors they can control for two main reasons.  

First, enabling students to perform non-trivial self-designed experiments without supervision places particular demands on the experimental tools.  They must be inherently safe and inexpensive, not to mention accessible to novice users.  A full kit of sensors, supplies, and an Arduino can be assembled for ~100 euros, and they run on 3-5 Volts.  The open-source hardware and software of the tools (as opposed to a “black-box” measurement device) afford students more insight and control into the measurement process.  Importantly, the Maker movement’s online resources support students with their practical questions – giving students the empowerment of overcoming hurdles and becoming DIY principal investigators.

Second, the mature and dynamic Maker movement has provided for a multitude of electronic sensors (including solid-state and MEMS technologies) which enable inquiries across a wide range of fields and at different levels of complexity.  As an additional perk of working with microcontrollers and sensors, students acquire transferable 21st century skills for their careers, as more sectors are transformed by data analytics, remote sensing, and IoT devices.  Students further appreciate learning about how many of these sensors enable functionalities in their own modern electronic devices.

## Adapting to new courses?

The Maker Lab materials in this repository are hopefully generally adaptable for various levels, institutions, and student groups, but it’s worth mentioning the pilot course from which they were derived:

The spring semester (2020) pilot Maker Lab course at Amsterdam University College was an interdisciplinary physical science lab course serving upper level natural science students, focusing on the empirical research cycle, measurement, uncertainties, and quantitative data modeling.  In this course, the only constraints on students' inquiries were that students must choose projects involving methods and/or concepts that go beyond high school material, and that they must use an Arduino in a non-trivial way in their experiments.

Anyone interested in doing similar things is encouraged to be in touch, as we can all learn from each other in adapting and improving the materials/methods to suit different needs and curricula.  Several lab instructors at different institutions are already interested in adapting these methods for a diverse array of courses, from freshman to senior level, and for physics majors and other natural science students.  There may be sufficient interest to form a Faculty Online Learning Community to share experiences and tips.
