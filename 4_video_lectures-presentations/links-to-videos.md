## Online 3rd party videos related to the Maker movement:

A fun 23 minute documentary on the Noisebridge Hackerspace that nicely explains the possibilities of physical Maker Spaces.   (Note: after the 14th minute, the video gets a bit sentimental...)

To give some extra background here, please note that Maker Spaces go by many different names:  
- repair cafes,
- maker spaces,
- hacker spaces,
- fablabs,
- tool lending libraries,
- university student machine & electronics shops,   

and they are found in different forms across the world. Besides these physical Maker Spaces, there are also digital Maker Spaces:  some in blog/vlog form, some maintained by companies, and others constituting forums where Makers from across the globe share ideas, questions, and tips.  In fact, participation in these Maker Lab projects earns us (students and instructors alike) the "Maker" title :-)
